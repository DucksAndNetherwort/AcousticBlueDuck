# AcousticBlueDuck

So, what does one do when faced with a massive bin of CB radio chassis? Turn them into bluetooth speaker kits of course!
With this kit, you too will be learning to melt alloy wire onto copper joints with a fancy metal stick! Not only that, but you'll be bringing a stereo bluetooth speaker system
with pretty decent audio quality, a custom enclosure, and custom side plates to your Humble Abode!
Not to mention the fact that you will also be recycling parts that would otherwise become e-waste, which, last i checked, 
is pretty bad for the environment... (The e-waste, that is. \*winks\*)

The CAD folder in this directory contains the, well, CAD files. It has it's own readme.
