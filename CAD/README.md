*Describe what the files are, or the pattern/structure of the files.*

*But first, decide if you're going to re-arrange the files into sub-directories, eg 3D, 2D, ... .*
*If you do create sub-directories, consider if the content is self-explantory to a beginner. If not it would be helpful to add a `readme.md`, even if it just says "see the readme.md in the parent directory".*
