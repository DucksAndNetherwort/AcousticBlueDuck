Welcome to the CAD directory! In this directory you will find all the design files for this project!  
  `3D fusion files` contains all the files for *fusion 360*  
  `3D stl files` contains all the *stl files* (you see where I'm going with this?)  
  `2D svg files` contains, you guessed it, contains all the *svg files*  
  
The fusion files can be opened with fusion 360,  
The stl files can be loaded into your slicer of choice for 3D printing,  
And finally, the svg files can be opened with inkscape. Though if you want to laser cut them, they've already been optomised for lazers.
